# Change Log
With this release the bot is for the most part done and functional, just a few bug fixes that need to be done on certain modules. I may add more features at a later date (I.E. Music Player) but as for now it does what we wanted it to accomplish for the discord server
# Install Instructions

1: Open config.json in your code editor and enter the token, prefix and client id in each of the quotation marks
Once you have that done, save the file.

2: open your command prompt (cmd.exe) and type "npm install discord.js nodemon --save" without the qoutes 

3: Once it has finished installing all the dependencies, you can run start.bat.

## Note: Like most things you may encounter errors if so report them to McZarya#0001 on discord
Reflux Software Developments or its employees not responsible for anything you do with this bot.
